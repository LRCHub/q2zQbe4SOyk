Atlanta burned again last night
All the water in the ocean couldn't put out the fire this time
They gave in to sin again but Lord it felt so right
When Atlanta burned again last night

She was over 30, he was barely 17
She was in her second marriage, he dated a high school queen
Somehow they came together in the heat of a Georgia night
He told her that he loved her as she turned out the light

Atlanta burned again last night
All the water in the ocean couldn't put out the fire this time
They gave in to sin again but Lord it felt so right
When Atlanta burned again last night

Her son was almost his age, he didn't seem to care
The only thing that mattered was the fever that they shared
As she pulled him closer, and Lord it felt so right
Two strangers turned to lovers on a red hot Georgia night

Atlanta burned again last night
All the water in the ocean couldn't put out the fire this time
They gave in to sin again but Lord it felt so right
When Atlanta burned again last night

She left in the morning, no tears in her eyes
What they shared that lonely night memory won't let die
Never stopped to wonder, they seemed to understand
It made her feel needed, she made him a man

Atlanta burned again last night
All the water in the ocean couldn't put out the fire this time
They gave in to sin again but Lord it felt so right
When Atlanta burned again last night
